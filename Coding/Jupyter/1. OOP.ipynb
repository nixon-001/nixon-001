    "### Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    ">- #### OOP is a paradigm(Pattern) that allow us to think and structure our code in a way that is easy to  maintain our code and also be organized at the same time as we write long and huge code. Say, we are programming a delivery drone, we break it into small pieces which relates to real world so that I can write code for its propellers and someone else can write code for camera and GPS and so on. Say, if we try to program a delivery bike we can use the same code for camera and  GPS that we have used for the drone and just write code for wheels. \n",
    ">- #### Everything in python is an object. Objects have methods and arguments which we can access by with a dot( .some_attribute). By using OOP we can create our own datatype with different attributes and methods (A function inside a class is called a method)"

    "### The 4 Pillars of OOP:\n",
    "1. #### Encapsulation\n",
    "> - Encapsulation in Python is the process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity.In programming, a class is an example that wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it.\n",
    "> - In the real world, consider your college as an example. Each and every department's student records are restricted only within the respective department. CSE department faculty cannot access the ECE department student record and so on. Here, the department acts as the class and student records act like variables and methods. \n",
    "> - #### Why Do We Need Encapsulation?\n",
    "> Encapsulation acts as a protective layer by ensuring that, access to wrapped data is not possible by any code defined outside the class in which the wrapped data are defined. Encapsulation provides security by hiding the data from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Abstraction\n",
    "> - Abstraction is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it.\n",
    "> -  For example, consider you have bought a new electronic gadget. Along with the gadget, you get a user guide, instructing how to use the application, but this user guide has no info regarding the internal working of the gadget.\n",
    "> - #### Why Do We Need Abstraction?\n",
    "Through the process of abstraction in Python, a programmer can hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Inheritance\n",
    "> - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n",
    "> - The class which inherits all the properties is called a child or derived class. And the class from which the properties are being derived is called parent or base class.\n",
    "> - #### Why Do We Need Inheritance?\n",
    "It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "> - #### How do we inherit a class?  Let's see that after the intro.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Polymorphism\n",
    "> - In general, polymorphism refers to the ability of a real-time object to represent itself in many forms.\n",
    "> - Consider yourself as a real-time example. When you are at college, you act as a student. When are at your home, you act like a child. You are a single person, but you represent yourself differently in different places.\n",
    "> - Similarly in the OOPs concept, polymorphism refers to the ability of a method to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.\n",
    "> - #### Why Do We Need Polymorphism?\n",
    "Polymorphism is used in Python programs when you have commonly named methods in two or more classes or subclasses. It allows these methods to use objects of different types at different times. So, it provides flexibility, using which a code can be extended and easily maintained over time."

    ">In python every class we create will inherit a main class called as 'object'. Have you ever noticed that when we instantiate a class and then we type 'objName.', we will get some suggestions(some dunder methods) that we haven't yet created. Those methods are the methods that we have inherited from the 'object' class. Wondering what is dunder method...haha"

    "#### Dunder (or) Magic Methods: \n",
    ">- Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These  are commonly used for operator overloading. Few examples for magic methods are:  \\_\\_init__ , \\_\\_add__ , \\_\\_len__ , \\_\\_repr__ etc.\n",
    ">- We can customize these dunder methods to our own needs. How could we do that? Just by creating a method using the name of the dunder methods just as we did with the \\_\\_init__ method. Customizing them also gives us an advantage of using it also as a function .We would have come across the 'len' function for strings. It is just a \\_\\_len__ method that the python developers added in the class str and modified it such that it showed the length of the string. Similarly while we are creating a class we can alse use these dunder methods to our advantage."
