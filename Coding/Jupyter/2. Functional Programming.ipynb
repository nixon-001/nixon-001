    "### Functional Praogramming: \n",
    "#### Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.\n",
    "#### Pure Variables:\n",
    "- There are 2 rules for a function to be pure:\n",
    "    1. When given the same input, it always gives same output.\n",
    "    2. It should not affect the outer world i.e say when print someting inside a function, it affects the outside world so instead we should return the value and print it outside a function.\n",
    "- When we have pure functions, we will have les buggy code\n",
    "- Pure functions is more of a guideline than an rule. It is impossible to have pure functions everywhere because if the function could not interact with the outside world we wouldn't be able to display and save things. Functional programming teaches us to use it whenever possible but not everywhere.\n"

    "#### Some useful functions:\n",
    "   - #### map():\n",
    "        - map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)\n",
    "        - Lets say we want the map function to multiply all the elements in the list we pass to it and return them in list form itself.\n",
    "        - In the map function there are two arguments. The first one is the action i.e the function and the second one is the iterable that we take action on.\n",
    "        - While we use map, it creates an object a random location in our machine so we are converting it into a list and printing it to get a desired output.\n",

    "        - Before that we should create a function that takes 2 parameters. The first one is the accumulator that gets its value from the third parameter in the reduce function and the second one is the item from the iterable we are using. If we dont pass an initial value in the reduce function, the accumulator will be initially zero. After the first iteration the accumulator takes the value of what we return in the accum function below. When the iteration through the whole list is finished, the reduce function will return the value which the accum function returns.\n",
