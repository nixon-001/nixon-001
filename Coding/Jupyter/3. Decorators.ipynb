    "### Decorators:\n",
    "- Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. But before diving deep into decorators let us understand some concepts that will come in handy in learning the decorators.\n",

    "- #### First Class Objects\n",
    "    - In Python, functions are first class objects that means that functions in Python can be used or passed as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Properties of first class functions:\n",
    "        - A function is an instance of the Object type.\n",
    "        - You can store the function in a variable.\n",
    "        - You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n",
    "        - You can return the function from a function.\n",
    "        - You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦\n",
    "    - Consider the below examples for better understanding.\n",
    "        - Example 1: Treating the functions as objects.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "          print('Hello')\n",
    "greet = hello\n",
    "greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "         - Example 2: Passing function as argument\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "          print('Hello')\n",
    "def greet(function):\n",
    "          function()\n",
    "greet(hello)\n",
    "```\n",
    "        - Example 3: Returning functions from another functions.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def create_adder(x):\n",
    "        def adder(y): \n",
    "            return x+y \n",
    "        return adder \n",

    "- #### Higher order functions(HOF):\n",
    "- A function that accepts another function as an argument or returns another function is an HOF\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### How to create and use a decorator? Lets see\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def main(func):\n",
    "        def wrapper():\n",
    "            print('*****')\n",
    "            func\n",
    "            print('*****')\n",
    "    @main \n",
    "    def hello():\n",
    "        print('Hello')\n",
    "    hello()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Without using decorator we can do:  mydecorator(hello)()\n",
    "    - But the parnthesis makes it look pretty confusing right. That's why we use decorators\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Uses of decorators:\n",
    "- Lets say we are scripting a performance decorator to know how much time a function takes to run.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from time import time\n",
    "def performance(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        t1 = time()\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        t2 = time()\n",
    "    print(f'The time took to run {func} is {t2 - t1} sec')\n",
    "@performance\n",
    "def longTime():\n",
    "    for i in range(100000000):\n",
