    "### Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    "- **OOP is a paradigm(Pattern) that allow us to think and structure our code in a way that is easy to  maintain our code and also be organized at the same time as we write long and huge code. Say, we are programming a delivery drone, we break it into small pieces which relates to real world so that I can write code for its propellers and someone else can write code for camera and GPS and so on. Now, if we try to program a delivery bike we can use the same code for camera and  GPS that we have used for the drone and just write code for wheels.**\n",
    "- **Everything in python is an object. Objects have methods and arguments which we can access by with a dot( .some_attribute). By using OOP we can create our own datatype with different attributes and methods (A function inside a class is called a method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A class can be created by using a class keyword i.e class ClassName:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:       # Class \n",
    "    pass               # Code\n",
    "object1 = ClassName()  # ()-instantiating a class    object1-an instance or object\n",
    "print(type(object1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP we have an idea of class and object. Class is the blueprint of what we wanna create, what are the basic attributes(Properties) and methods(action) that a class can take. From this blueprint we can create objects. Technically we say a class is instantiated to create an instance of a class i.e an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start our OOP journey with an example. Lets say we are creating a game.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PlayerCharacter:    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, charName, charAge):\n",
    "        self.name = charName\n",
    "        self.age = charAge\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print('run')\n",
    "    membership = True  #Class object attribute\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def shout(cls):\n",
    "        print('shout')\n",
    "player1 = PlayerCharacter('Nixon',10)     #Instantiating\n",
    "player2 = PlayerCharacter('Reuel',20)\n",
    "print(player1.name)                 # (player1 or 2)  (.name or .age)\n",
    "player1.run()                       # or player2.run()\n",
    "print(PlayerCharacter.membership)   # or print(player1(or 2).membership)\n",
    "PlayerCharacter.shout()             # or player1(or 2).shout()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\_\\_init__ Method:\n",
    "- It is also called a constructor function. Every class contains an **init** method. While we instantiate a class this **init** method gets run first. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self keyword:\n",
    "- Self allows us to code dynamically i.e It helps us to have a reference to an object that hasn't been created yet(i.e player1 and player2). So, we can say objName.some_attribute = aVariable so while we print objName.some_attribute, aVariable gets printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Object Attribute:\n",
    "- Some attributes contain __'self.'__ before them. So they are dynamic. But class object attribute is static so when you print objName.classObjAttr, for all objects it just prints the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### @classmethod:\n",
    "- It is similar to the class object attribute but for method i.e unlike other methods it is static and for whatever objName we use, it gives the same output. Here, the cls argument just refers to the class name. And there is also @staticmethod which is pretty similar to @classmethod but it does not take in the cls argument\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 4 Pillars of OOP:\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
    "    - Encapsulation in Python is the process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity.In programming, a class is an example that wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it.\n",
    "    - In the real world, consider your college as an example. Each and every department's student records are restricted only within the respective department. CSE department faculty cannot access the ECE department student record and so on. Here, the department acts as the class and student records act like variables and methods. \n",
    "    - #### Why Do We Need Encapsulation?\n",
    "         Encapsulation acts as a protective layer by ensuring that, access to wrapped data is not possible by any code defined outside the class in which the wrapped data are defined. Encapsulation provides security by hiding the data from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it.\n",
    "    -  For example, consider you have bought a new electronic gadget. Along with the gadget, you get a user guide, instructing how to use the application, but this user guide has no info regarding the internal working of the gadget.\n",
    "    - #### Why Do We Need Abstraction?\n",
    "        Through the process of abstraction in Python, a programmer can hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**\n",
    "    - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n",
    "    - The class which inherits all the properties is called a child or derived class. And the class from which the properties are being derived is called parent or base class.\n",
    "    - **Why Do We Need Inheritance?**\n",
    "        It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "        It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "        It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "            class Class1:\n",
    "                def test(self):\n",
    "                    return 'Yes'\n",
    "            class Class2(Class1):\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "            obj1 = Class1()\n",
    "            print(obj1.test())\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "    - In general, polymorphism refers to the ability of a real-time object to represent itself in many forms.\n",
    "    - Consider yourself as a real-time example. When you are at college, you act as a student. When are at your home, you act like a child. You are a single person, but you represent yourself differently in different places.\n",
    "    - Similarly in the OOPs concept, polymorphism refers to the ability of a method to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.\n",
    "    - **Why Do We Need Polymorphism?**\n",
    "        Polymorphism is used in Python programs when you have commonly named methods in two or more classes or subclasses. It allows these methods to use objects of different types at different times. So, it provides flexibility, using which a code can be extended and easily maintained over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fun fact: \n",
    "- In python every class we create will inherit a main class called as 'object'. Have you ever noticed that when we instantiate a class and then we type 'objName.', we will get some suggestions(some dunder methods) that we haven't yet created. Those methods are the methods that we have inherited from the 'object' class. Wondering what is dunder method...haha\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dunder (or) Magic Methods: \n",
    "- Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These  are commonly used for operator overloading. Few examples for magic methods are:  \\_\\_init\\_\\_ , \\_\\_add\\_\\_ , \\_\\_len\\_\\_ , \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ etc.\n",
    "- We can customize these dunder methods to our own needs. How could we do that? Just by creating a method using the name of the dunder methods just as we did with the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method. Customizing them also gives us an advantage of using it also as a function .We would have come across the 'len' function for strings. It is just a \\_\\_len\\_\\_ method that the python developers added in the class str and modified it such that it showed the length of the string. Similarly while we are creating a class we can alse use these dunder methods to our advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips: \n",
    "- \\_\\_call\\_\\_ is a special dunder method(not actually) that we can modify in our class. Say if we have modified it to print 'hi'. Then when we instantiate that class and execute objName() just as we call a function, we would get the output as 'hi'"

    "### Functional Programming: \n",
    "#### Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.\n",
    "#### Pure Variables:\n",
    "- There are 2 rules for a function to be pure:\n",
    "    1. When given the same input, it always gives same output.\n",
    "    2. It should not affect the outer world i.e say when print someting inside a function, it affects the outside world so instead we should return the value and print it outside a function.\n",
    "- When we have pure functions, we will have les buggy code\n",
    "- Pure functions is more of a guideline than an rule. It is impossible to have pure functions everywhere because if the function could not interact with the outside world we wouldn't be able to display and save things. Functional programming teaches us to use it whenever possible but not everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some useful functions:\n",
    "- **map():**\n",
    "    - map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)\n",
    "    - Lets say we want the map function to multiply all the elements in the list we pass to it and return them in list form itself.\n",
    "    - In the map function there are two arguments. The first one is the action i.e the function and the second one is the iterable that we take action on.\n",
    "    - While we use map, it creates an object a random location in our machine so we are converting it into a list and printing it to get a desired output.\n",
    "    - map function also acknowledges the idea of pure function i.e it doesn't modify the variable 'list1' itself but just creates a new object and stores the results.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        list1 = [1,2,3]\n",
    "        def twice(item):\n",
    "            return item*2\n",
    "        print(list(map(twice, list1)))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **filter():**\n",
    "    - As the name suggests, when we use filter() we are just filtering our results. Now lets see how we can use the filter function to shrink our code.\n",
    "    - In this function too there are two arguments. The first one is the action i.e the function and the second one is the iterable that we take action on.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "        def onlyOdd(item):\n",
    "            return item%2 != 0\n",
    "        print(list(filter(onlyOdd,list1)))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **zip():**\n",
    "    - The zip function zips two or more iterables togeather.Pretty self explanatory right. An example makes it much more clear so lets see one.\n",
    "    - In the below example the zip function puts togeather the respective elements of the two iterables passed to it into a list of tuples.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        list1 = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "        list2 = [5,6,7,8]\n",
    "        print(list(zip(list1, list2)))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reduce():**\n",
    "    - Reduce doesn't come as a part of python built in functions. For us to use reduce we should import reduce from functools\n",
    "    - It takes 3 parameters. The first one is the function and the second one is a sequence and the third is an initial value that defaults to zero if we leave it empty\n",
    "    - Before that we should create a function that takes 2 parameters. The first one is the accumulator that gets its value from the third parameter in the reduce function and the second one is the item from the iterable we are using. If we dont pass an initial value in the reduce function, the accumulator will be initially zero. After the first iteration the accumulator takes the value of what we return in the accum function below. When the iteration through the whole list is finished, the reduce function will return the value which the accum function returns.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        from functools import reduce\n",
    "        list1 = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "            def accum(acc, item):\n",
    "            print(acc, item)   # This line is just to see what we are doing \n",
    "            return acc + item\n",
    "        print(reduce(accum, list1)) \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: All the functions mentioned above also acknowledges the idea of pure function i.e it doesn't modify the variable itself but just creates a new object and stores the results in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lambda expressions:\n",
    "- In Python, an anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python. It has the following syntax: \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    lambda parameters: expression(the content of the function)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Where are they used? Say, now we are using the filter function, instead of defining a function that returns a boolean value and passing the function to it, we can directly pass a lambda function to the filter function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comprension:\n",
    "- **List comprehension:**\n",
    "    - One of the most distinctive aspects of the language is the python list and the list compression feature, which one can use within a single line of code to construct powerful functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables like tuples, strings, arrays, lists, etc.\n",
    "    - The syntax of the list comprehension is as follows\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        list1 = [logic for parameter in iterable if condition]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - Lets create a list using comprehension which contains the odd numbers in range 1 - 100 multiplied by 2\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        list1 = [i*2 for i in range(101) if i%2 != 0]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "- **Set comprehension:**\n",
    "    - Set comprehensions are pretty similar to list comprehensions. The only difference between them is that set comprehensions use curly brackets { }. \n",
    "    - As we all know we cant have repeated value in sets.\n",
    "    - Let’s look at the following example to understand set comprehensions.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7]\n",
    "        list2 = (var for var in list1 if var % 2 == 0)\n",
    "        print(list2)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "     \n",
    "- **Dictionary comprehension:**\n",
    "    - Like List Comprehension, Python allows dictionary comprehensions. We can create dictionaries using simple expressions.\n",
    "    - A dictionary comprehension takes the form \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        {key: value for (key, value) in iterable}\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Let’s see a example. Lets multiply the values in the dictionary by 2.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        myDict = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4}\n",
    "        newDict = {k:v*2 for k,v in myDict.items()}\n",
    "        print(newDict)\n",
    "        ```\n",

    "    - Now if we give input as abcde, it would give an output saying that 'Enter a valid information'. We don't want the user to be 0 yr old right, so we are including some number/ input in try block. Now if we give the input as 0, it would give an output saying that 'You are probably not zero'. \n",
    "    - We are having the else block with break in it to break out of the while loop as soon as we enter correct information. \n",
    "    - Finally is a special block because the code in it gets executed irrelevent of the input we give. Either we give a valid or an invalid input, it gets executed. Even though if we have the break statement in the else block which is above it, 'finally' gets executed and then, it breaks out of the loop. "

    "#### Iterators: \n",
    "- Iterator in python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. The iterator object is initialized using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration.\n",
    "    - \\_\\_iter(iterable)\\_\\_ method that is called for the initialization of an iterator. This returns an iterator object\n",
    "    - \\_\\_next()\\_\\_ method returns the next value for the iterable. When we use a for loop to traverse any iterable object, internally it uses the iter() method to get an iterator object which further uses next() method to iterate over. This method raises a StopIteration to signal the end of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yield statement:\n",
    "- The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list.\n",
    "- Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don’t want to store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "- Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator-Function : \n",
    "- A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator-Object : \n",
    "- Generator functions return a generator object. Generator objects are used either by calling the next method on the generator object or using the generator object in a “for in” loop . So a generator function returns an generator object that is iterable, i.e., can be used as an Iterators .\n",
    "\n",
    "- **An Example:** \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def genFunc(num):\n",
    "        for i in range(num):\n",
    "            yield i \n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now lets analyse what's going on. \n",
    "- First we define a function **genFunc** which ends with yield statement. So, it becomes a generator. \n",
    "- Then we are creating an an object **gen** which calls the generator function. \n",
    "- As we have used the yield statement, the program pauses after yielding the value until we give the command to continue. \n",
    "- For that we are using the **next** keyword. When we run **next(gen)**, the generator functio yields 0. We use print(next(gen)) to print it to the screen. When we run it again, it returns 1 and so on...  \n",

As your program grows more in the size you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance as well as reusability of the code. The solution to this is Modules. You can define your most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs. A module can be imported by another program to make use of its functionality. This is how you can use the Python standard library as well.\n",

When we open a file  it returns a cursor and the contents of the file that we can read and the contents of the file are read with a cursor which moves as we read a file so if we print the file once cursor would be in end and afert that if we try to print it, it just gives blank space.  \n",
