After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, for example getting the user to type something in.\n",

    "* **Lists** are what they seem - a list of values. Each one of them is numbered, starting from zero - the first one is numbered zero, the second 1, the third 2, etc. You can remove values from the list, and add new values to the end. Example: Your many cats' names.\n",
    "* **Tuples** are just like lists, but you can't change their values. The values that you give it first up, are the values that you are stuck with for the rest of the program. Again, each value is numbered starting from zero, for easy reference. Example: the names of the months of the year.\n",
    "* **Dictionaries** are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In Python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they aren't in any specific order, either - the key does the same thing. You can add, remove, and modify the values in dictionaries. Example: telephone book."

    "# 7. Classes\n",
    "## 7.1 Introduction\n",
    "One thing that you will get to know about programming, is that programmers like to be lazy. If something has been done before, why should you do it again?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what functions cover in Python. You've already had your code do something special. Now you want to do it again. You put that special code into a function, and re-use it for all it is worth. You can refer to a function anywhere in your code, and the computer will always know what you are talking about. Handy, eh?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, functions have their limitations. Functions don't store any information like variables do - every time a function is run, it starts afresh. However, certain functions and variables are related to each other very closely, and need to interact with each other a lot. For example, imagine you have a golf club. It has information about it (i.e. variables) like the length of the shaft, the material of the grip, and the material of the head. It also has functions associated with it, like the function of swinging your golf club, or the function of breaking it in pure frustration. For those functions, you need to know the variables of the shaft length, head material, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "That can easily be worked around with normal functions. Parameters affect the effect of a function. But what if a function needs to affect variables? What happens if each time you use your golf club, the shaft gets weaker, the grip on the handle wears away a little, you get that little more frustrated, and a new scratch is formed on the head of the club? A function cannot do that. A function only makes one output, not four or five, or five hundred. What is needed is a way to group functions and variables that are closely related into one place so that they can interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that you also have more than one golf club. Without classes, you need to write a whole heap of code for each different golf club. This is a pain, seeing that all clubs share common features, it is just that some have changed properties - like what the shaft is made of, and it's weight. The ideal situation would be to have a design of your basic golf club. Each time you create a new club, simply specify its attributes - the length of its shaft, its weight, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or what if you want a golf club, which has added extra features? Maybe you decide to attach a clock to your golf club (why, I don't know - it was your idea). Does this mean that we have to create this golf club from scratch? We would have to write code first for our basic golf club, plus all of that again, and the code for the clock, for our new design. Wouldn't it be better if we were to just take our existing golf club, and then tack the code for the clock to it?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are problems that a thing called object-oriented-programming solves. It puts functions and variables together in a way that they can see each other and work together, be replicated, and altered as needed, and not when unneeded. And we use a thing called a `class` to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.2 Creating a `Class`\n",
    "What is a class? Think of a class as a blueprint. It isn't something in itself, it simply describes how to make something. You can create lots of objects from that blueprint - known technically as an *instance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you make these so-called 'classes'? very easily, with the `class` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Defining a class\n",
    "class class_name:\n",

    "    [statement 2]\n",
    "    [statement 3]\n",
    "    [etc]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes little sense? That's okay, here is an example, that creates the definition of a `Shape`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",

    "Did you try to run `print(fl.read())` a second time? Did it fail? It likely did, and reason is because the 'cursor' has changed it's place. Cursor? What cursor? Well, a cursor that you really cannot see, but still a cursor. This invisible cursor tells the read function (and many other I/O functions) where to start from. To set where the cursor is, you use the `seek()` function. It is used in the form `seek(offset, whence)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 9.4 Other I/O Functions\n",
    "There are many other functions that help you with dealing with files. They have many uses that empower you to do more, and make the things you can do easier. Let's have a look at `tell()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`, `write()` and `close()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tell()` returns where the cursor is in the file. It has no parameters, just type it in (like what the example below will show). This is infinitely useful, for knowing what you are referring to, where it is, and simple control of the cursor. To use it, type `fileobjectname.tell()` - where fileobjectname is the name of the file object you created when you opened the file (in `openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r')` the file object name is `openfile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`readline()` reads from where the cursor is till the end of the line. Remember that the end of the line isn't the edge of your screen - the line ends when you press enter to create a new line. This is useful for things like reading a log of events, or going through something progressively to process it. There are no parameters you have to pass to `readline()`, though you can optionally tell it the maximum number of bytes/letters to read by putting a number in the brackets. Use it with `fileobjectname.readline()`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`readlines()` is much like `readline()`, however `readlines()` reads all the lines from the cursor onwards, and returns a list, with each list element holding a line of code. Use it with `fileobjectname.readlines()`. For example, if you had the text file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Line 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 3\n",
    "Line 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the returned list from `readlines()` would be:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | Value |\n",
    "| :--: | :--: |\n",
    "| 0 | 'Line 1' |\n",
    "| 1 | \" |\n",
    "| 2 | 'Line 3' |\n",
    "| 3 | 'Line 4' |\n",
    "| 4 | \" |\n",
    "| 5 | 'Line 6' |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `write()` function, writes to the file. How did you guess??? It writes from where the cursor is, and overwrites text in front of it - like in MS Word, where you press 'insert' and it writes over the top of old text. To utilise this most purposeful function, put a string between the brackets to write e.g. `fileobjectname.write('this is a string')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`close`, you may figure, closes the file so that you can no longer read or write to it until you reopen in again. Simple enough. To use, you would write `fileobjectname.close()`. Simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course you can try this in the Python command line. Open up a test file (or create a new one...) and play around with these functions. You can do some simple (and very inconvenient) text editing."

    "### Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    "- #### OOP is a paradigm(Pattern) that allow us to think and structure our code in a way that is easy to  maintain our code and also be organized at the same time as we write long and huge code. Say, we are programming a delivery drone, we break it into small pieces which relates to real world so that I can write code for its propellers and someone else can write code for camera and GPS and so on. Say, if we try to program a delivery bike we can use the same code for camera and  GPS that we have used for the drone and just write code for wheels. \n",
    "- #### Everything in python is an object. Objects have methods and arguments which we can access by with a dot( .some_attribute). By using OOP we can create our own datatype with different attributes and methods (A function inside a class is called a method)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A class can be created by using a class keyword i.e class ClassName:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:       # Class \n",
    "    pass               # Code\n",
    "object1 = ClassName()  # ()-instantiating a class    object1-an instance or object\n",
    "print(type(object1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP we have an idea of class and object. Class is the blueprint of what we wanna create, what are the basic attributes(Properties) and methods(action) that a class can take. From this blueprint we can create objects. Technically we say a class is instantiated to create an instance of a class i.e an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start our OOP journey with an example. Lets say we are creating a game.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PlayerCharacter:    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, charName, charAge):\n",
    "        self.name = charName\n",
    "        self.age = charAge\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print('run')\n",
    "    membership = True  #Class object attribute\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def shout(cls):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \\_\\_init__ Method:\n",
    "- It is also called a constructor function. Every class contains an **init** method. While we instantiate a class this **init** method gets run first. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self keyword:\n",
    "- Self allows us to code dynamically i.e It helps us to have a reference to an object that hasn't been created yet(i.e player1 and player2). So, we can say objName.some_attribute = aVariable so while we print objName.some_attribute, aVariable gets printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Object Attribute:\n",
    "- Some attributes contain __'self.'__ before them. So they are dynamic. But class object attribute is static so when you print objName.classObjAttr, for all objects it just prints the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### @classmethod:\n",
    "- It is similar to the class object attribute but for method i.e unlike other methods it is static and for whatever objName we use, it gives the same output. Here, the cls argument just refers to the class name. And there is also @staticmethod which is pretty similar to @classmethod but it does not take in the cls argument\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 4 Pillars of OOP:\n",
    "1. #### Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Encapsulation in Python is the process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity.In programming, a class is an example that wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it.\n",
    "    - In the real world, consider your college as an example. Each and every department's student records are restricted only within the respective department. CSE department faculty cannot access the ECE department student record and so on. Here, the department acts as the class and student records act like variables and methods. \n",
    "    - #### Why Do We Need Encapsulation?\n",
    "         Encapsulation acts as a protective layer by ensuring that, access to wrapped data is not possible by any code defined outside the class in which the wrapped data are defined. Encapsulation provides security by hiding the data from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Abstraction\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it.\n",
    "    -  For example, consider you have bought a new electronic gadget. Along with the gadget, you get a user guide, instructing how to use the application, but this user guide has no info regarding the internal working of the gadget.\n",
    "    - #### Why Do We Need Abstraction?\n",
    "        Through the process of abstraction in Python, a programmer can hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Inheritance\n",
    "    - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n",
    "    - The class which inherits all the properties is called a child or derived class. And the class from which the properties are being derived is called parent or base class.\n",
    "    - #### Why Do We Need Inheritance?\n",
    "        It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "        It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "        It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Class1:\n",
    "    def test(self):\n",
    "        return 'Yes'\n",
    "class Class2(Class1):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "obj1 = Class1()\n",
    "print(obj1.test())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Polymorphism\n",
    "    - In general, polymorphism refers to the ability of a real-time object to represent itself in many forms.\n",
    "    - Consider yourself as a real-time example. When you are at college, you act as a student. When are at your home, you act like a child. You are a single person, but you represent yourself differently in different places.\n",
    "    - Similarly in the OOPs concept, polymorphism refers to the ability of a method to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.\n",
    "    - #### Why Do We Need Polymorphism?\n",
    "        Polymorphism is used in Python programs when you have commonly named methods in two or more classes or subclasses. It allows these methods to use objects of different types at different times. So, it provides flexibility, using which a code can be extended and easily maintained over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fun fact: \n",
    "- In python every class we create will inherit a main class called as 'object'. Have you ever noticed that when we instantiate a class and then we type 'objName.', we will get some suggestions(some dunder methods) that we haven't yet created. Those methods are the methods that we have inherited from the 'object' class. Wondering what is dunder method...haha\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dunder (or) Magic Methods: \n",
    "- Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These  are commonly used for operator overloading. Few examples for magic methods are:  \\_\\_init__ , \\_\\_add__ , \\_\\_len__ , \\_\\_repr__ etc.\n",
    "- We can customize these dunder methods to our own needs. How could we do that? Just by creating a method using the name of the dunder methods just as we did with the \\_\\_init__ method. Customizing them also gives us an advantage of using it also as a function .We would have come across the 'len' function for strings. It is just a \\_\\_len__ method that the python developers added in the class str and modified it such that it showed the length of the string. Similarly while we are creating a class we can alse use these dunder methods to our advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips: \n",
    "- \\_\\_call__ is a special dunder method(not actually) that we can modify in our class. Say if we have modified it to print 'hi'. Then when we instantiate that class and execute objName() just as we call a function, we would get the output as 'hi'"

    "### Functional Programming: \n",
    "#### Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.\n",
    "#### Pure Variables:\n",
    "- There are 2 rules for a function to be pure:\n",
    "    1. When given the same input, it always gives same output.\n",
    "    2. It should not affect the outer world i.e say when print someting inside a function, it affects the outside world so instead we should return the value and print it outside a function.\n",
    "- When we have pure functions, we will have les buggy code\n",
    "- Pure functions is more of a guideline than an rule. It is impossible to have pure functions everywhere because if the function could not interact with the outside world we wouldn't be able to display and save things. Functional programming teaches us to use it whenever possible but not everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some useful functions:\n",
    "   - #### map():\n",
    "        - map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)\n",
    "        - Lets say we want the map function to multiply all the elements in the list we pass to it and return them in list form itself.\n",
    "        - In the map function there are two arguments. The first one is the action i.e the function and the second one is the iterable that we take action on.\n",
    "        - While we use map, it creates an object a random location in our machine so we are converting it into a list and printing it to get a desired output.\n",
    "        - map function also acknowledges the idea of pure function i.e it doesn't modify the variable 'list1' itself but just creates a new object and stores the results.\n",
    "         ```python\n",
    "    list1 = [1,2,3]\n",
    "def twice(item):\n",
    "    return item*2\n",
    "print(list(map(twice, list1)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - #### filter():\n",
    "        - As the name suggests, when we use filter() we are just filtering our results. Now lets see how we can use the filter function to shrink our code.\n",
    "        - In this function too there are two arguments. The first one is the action i.e the function and the second one is the iterable that we take action on.\n",
    "         ```python\n",
    "list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "def onlyOdd(item):\n",
    "    return item%2 != 0\n",
    "print(list(filter(onlyOdd,list1)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - #### zip():\n",
    "        - The zip function zips two or more iterables togeather.Pretty self explanatory right. An example makes it much more clear so lets see one.\n",
    "        - In the below example the zip function puts togeather the respective elements of the two iterables passed to it into a list of tuples.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "list1 = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "list2 = [5,6,7,8]\n",
    "print(list(zip(list1, list2)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - #### reduce():\n",
    "        - Reduce doesn't come as a part of python built in functions. For us to use reduce we should import reduce from functools\n",
    "        - It takes 3 parameters. The first one is the function and the second one is a sequence and the third is an initial value that defaults to zero if we leave it empty\n",
    "        - Before that we should create a function that takes 2 parameters. The first one is the accumulator that gets its value from the third parameter in the reduce function and the second one is the item from the iterable we are using. If we dont pass an initial value in the reduce function, the accumulator will be initially zero. After the first iteration the accumulator takes the value of what we return in the accum function below. When the iteration through the whole list is finished, the reduce function will return the value which the accum function returns.\n",
    "         ```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "list1 = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "def accum(acc, item):\n",
    "    print(acc, item)   # This line is just to see what we are doing \n",
    "    return acc + item\n",
    "print(reduce(accum, list1)) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: All the functions mentioned above also acknowledges the idea of pure function i.e it doesn't modify the variable itself but just creates a new object and stores the results in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lambda expressions:\n",
    "- In Python, an anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python. It has the following syntax: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda parameters: expression(the content of the function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Where are they used? Say, now we are using the filter function, instead of defining a function that returns a boolean value and passing the function to it, we can directly pass a lambda function to the filter function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comprension:\n",
    "- #### List comprehension:\n",
    "     - One of the most distinctive aspects of the language is the python list and the list compression feature, which one can use within a single line of code to construct powerful functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables like tuples, strings, arrays, lists, etc.\n",
    "     - The syntax of the list comprehension is as follows\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "          list1 = [logic for parameter in iterable if condition]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "     - Lets create a list using comprehension which contains the odd numbers in range 1 - 100 multiplied by 2\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "          list1 = [i*2 for i in range(101) if i%2 != 0]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "- #### Set comprehension:\n",
    "     - Set comprehensions are pretty similar to list comprehensions. The only difference between them is that set comprehensions use curly brackets { }. \n",
    "     - As we all know we cant have repeated value in sets.\n",
    "     - Let’s look at the following example to understand set comprehensions.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7]\n",
    "list2 = (var for var in list1 if var % 2 == 0)\n",
    "print(list2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "     \n",
    "- #### Dictionary comprehension:\n",
    "     - Like List Comprehension, Python allows dictionary comprehensions. We can create dictionaries using simple expressions.\n",
    "     - A dictionary comprehension takes the form \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "        {key: value for (key, value) in iterable}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "    myDict = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4}\n",
    "    newDict = {k:v*2 for k,v in myDict.items()}\n",

    "### Decorators:\n",
    "- Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. But before diving deep into decorators let us understand some concepts that will come in handy in learning the decorators.\n",

    "    - In Python, functions are first class objects that means that functions in Python can be used or passed as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Properties of first class functions:\n",
    "        - A function is an instance of the Object type.\n",
    "        - You can store the function in a variable.\n",
    "        - You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n",
    "        - You can return the function from a function.\n",
    "        - You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, …\n",
    "    - Consider the below examples for better understanding.\n",
    "        - Example 1: Treating the functions as objects.\n",

    "### Python Exception Handling:\n",
    "- Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. \n",
    "    - **Syntax Error**: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program.\n",
    "    - **Exceptions**: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exception Handling:\n",
    "- When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message. These exceptions can be handled using the try statement.\n",
    "- Lets understand it through an example\n",
    "```python\n",

    "      print(x)\n",
    "except:\n",
    "      print(\"An exception occurred\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined. Since the try block raises an error, the except block will be executed. Without the try block, the program will crash and raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets see another example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(input('Enter your age: '))\n",
    "        100/age\n",

    "        print('Enter a valid information')\n",

    "        print('This line is due to finally')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- #### Analysis:\n",
    "    - We want to run the code until the user gives a correct input, so we are using while loop to do that.\n",
    "    - The main logic is in the try block and we are getting an integer as an input. \n",
    "    - Now if we give input as abcde, it would give an output saying that 'Enter a valid information'. We don't want the user to be 0 yr old right, so we are including some number/ input in try block. Now if we give the input as 0, it would give an output saying that 'You are probably not zero'. \n",
    "    - We are having the else block with break in it to break out of the while loop as soon as we enter correct information. \n",
    "    - Finally is a special block because the code in it gets executed irrelevent of the input we give. Either we give a valid or an invalid input, it gets executed. Even though if we have the break statement in the else block which is above it, 'finally' gets executed and then, it breaks out of the loop. "
